**Giving Back to Supporters** 

Every vote to DooTron is equally valued and will be given its fair share of node operation reward. The TRX reward will be distributed by the following discipline:
* 80% of all reward will go back to our supporters, allocated by the proportion to all votes cast
* 10% of all reward will be frozen in exchange of energy, providing DooTron community a more affordable gaming experience
* 10% of all reward will be preserved by DooTron to compensate the expenses of operation and future server upgrades

**Token Issuance**

After DooTron is officially elected as Super Representative, we will issue another token as additional rewards to our loyal community members. Each token will represent a vote in DooTronâ€™s community plan making. Since the token will be distributed proportionally, more votes from a voter results in more weights of his/her opinion.

Besides serving as voting certificates, we plan to integrate the token into DooTron platform as well. Token hodlers will be able to collect dividends and betting directly with the token they receive as supportive voters.
